The aim with this project is to create a solution that allows us to track where MAC numbers connect to our network. This will be done by probing the network switches periodically, and retrieving their forwarding tables.Using that information we can search,add and remove the devices from the table. If a match is found, the response will return what switches, vlans and ports are aware of the MAC address. The project contains following files.

1. config.php.txt
2. addDevice.php.txt
3. removeDevice.php.txt
4. search.php.txt
5. list.php.txt
6. listDevs.php.txt
7. backend.txt
8. mygit.log
